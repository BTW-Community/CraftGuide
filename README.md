# CraftGuide Addon for Better Than Wolves
CraftGuide allows players to view recipes in-game by pressing a key (`G` by default) and alleviates the tedium of having to remember or lookup recipes.
This particular addon fixes previous versions of CraftGuide not displaying certain recipes in [Better Than Wolves](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/3117153-better-than-wolves-community-edition).

> If you want to make a custom version of CraftGuide, use bits of its code, or just see how it works, you can find the source code [on Github](https://github.com/Uristqwerty/CraftGuide).
If you want to use some (or all) of it in your own project, you are free to do so, though it would be nice if you mentioned CraftGuide in a text file or somewhere else where someone can find it.
